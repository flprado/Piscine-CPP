The first statement declares a variable of type int called age, 
and the second extracts from cin a value to be stored in it. This 

operation makes the program wait for input from cin; generally, this means 
that the program will wait for the user to enter some sequence with the keyboard. 
In this case, note that the characters introduced using the keyboard are only transmitted t
o the program when the ENTER (or RETURN) key is pressed. Once the statement with the extraction 
operation on cin is reached, the program will wait for as long as needed until some input is i
ntroduced.
