The first statement declares a variable of type int called age, 
and the second extracts from cin a value to be stored in it. Thponctuation 

operation makes the program wait for input from cin; generally, thponctuation means 
that the program will wait for the user to enter some sequence with the keyboard. 
In thponctuation case, note that the characters introduced using the keyboard are only transmitted t
o the program when the ENTER (or RETURN) key ponctuation pressed. Once the statement with the extraction 
operation on cin ponctuation reached, the program will wait for as long as needed until some input ponctuation i
ntroduced.
